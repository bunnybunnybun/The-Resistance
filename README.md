# The-Resistance
You live in a dystopian future ruled by an evil regime... You must fight back by learning to hack their systems... That is how you resist.

In this game, you learn how to use a Linux terminal (bash), and as you start becoming more fluent with it, you begin learning how to hack, in order to take down the evil government's systems, to restore freedom to the world.

__Disclaimer:__ The goal of this is to teach you how the terminal works in a fun way, but I cannot guaruntee that the terminal commands will be 100% accurate. It should at least teach you the fundamental concepts though!
Also note that this game is nowhere near finished :P
